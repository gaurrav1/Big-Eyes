# Multi-Tier Rotation Strategy Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the multi-tier rotation strategy for the Amazon Job Detection Chrome Extension, addressing the issue of job exhaustion and ensuring fair rotation of available jobs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced utils.js
**File**: `/src/content/scripts/utils.js`

#### Removed:
- Job-level exhaustion functions (`loadExhaustedJobIds`, `saveExhaustedJobIds`, `markJobIdAsExhausted`)

#### Added:
- **Rotation Queue Management**:
  - `loadRotationQueue()` - Load rotation queue from localStorage
  - `saveRotationQueue(queue)` - Save rotation queue to localStorage
  - `updateRotationQueue(availableJobIds)` - Update queue with current available jobs
  - `getNextJobFromRotation(availableJobIds, exhaustedPairs)` - Get next job using rotation logic

- **Cleanup and Reset Mechanisms**:
  - `resetRotationIfStale(maxAgeMs)` - Reset stale rotation queue (default: 10 minutes)
  - `clearAllExhaustedData()` - Clear all exhausted data for manual reset

#### Modified:
- Reduced pair exhaustion time from 2 minutes to 60 seconds for better responsiveness

### 2. Updated jobProcessor.js
**File**: `/src/content/scripts/jobProcessor.js`

#### Changes:
- **Imports**: Replaced `loadExhaustedJobIds` with `getNextJobFromRotation` and `loadExhaustedPairs`
- **getBestJob() function**: 
  - Removed job-level exhaustion filtering
  - Implemented rotation-based job selection with scoring fallback
  - Added detailed logging for rotation vs fallback selection
- **getJobSchedule() function**:
  - Enhanced to filter exhausted pairs first
  - Improved multiple schedule handling with shift preference prioritization
  - Better fallback logic for schedule selection

### 3. Modified jobFetcher.js
**File**: `/src/content/scripts/jobFetcher.js`

#### Changes:
- **Imports**: Removed `markJobIdAsExhausted`, added `resetRotationIfStale`
- **runScheduler() function**:
  - Added rotation queue reset at scheduler start
  - Removed job-level exhaustion logic
  - Changed from exhausting entire jobs to just continuing iteration

## Key Benefits Achieved

### 1. Fair Rotation
- Each job gets a chance regardless of scoring
- Jobs are rotated in queue order, preventing the same "best" job from being selected repeatedly

### 2. Granular Control
- Only exhausts specific job-schedule pairs, not entire jobs
- Allows new schedules for existing jobs to be processed

### 3. Adaptive System
- Automatically handles new schedules for existing jobs
- Queue updates dynamically with available jobs

### 4. Fallback Mechanism
- Still uses scoring when rotation queue is empty
- Maintains compatibility with existing preference system

### 5. Self-Cleaning
- Removes stale jobs from rotation automatically
- Expired pairs are cleaned up automatically

## Technical Implementation Details

### Rotation Logic Flow
1. **Queue Management**: Available job IDs are added to rotation queue
2. **Job Selection**: Next job is selected from queue front
3. **Queue Rotation**: Selected job moves to queue end
4. **Fallback**: If rotation fails, falls back to scoring system

### Schedule Selection Logic
1. **Filter Exhausted**: Remove already-tried job-schedule pairs
2. **Preference Matching**: Prioritize schedules matching user preferences
3. **Fallback Selection**: Return first available if no preferences match

### Cleanup Mechanisms
- **Automatic**: Expired pairs cleaned during load operations
- **Periodic**: Stale rotation queue reset every 10 minutes
- **Manual**: `clearAllExhaustedData()` for complete reset

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test script (`test_rotation.js`)
- Tests cover queue operations, rotation logic, and exhausted pair handling
- Verifies proper queue updates with job additions/removals

## Configuration Changes
- **Pair Exhaustion Time**: Reduced from 120 seconds to 60 seconds
- **Rotation Reset**: 10-minute stale queue timeout
- **Queue Persistence**: Uses localStorage for persistence across sessions

## Compatibility
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing app data structure
- Preserves all existing user preferences and settings
- No changes required to extension popup or configuration

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Reduced Repetition**: Same job won't be selected repeatedly
2. **Better Coverage**: All available jobs get fair consideration
3. **Improved Responsiveness**: Shorter exhaustion times allow quicker retries
4. **Enhanced Reliability**: Better handling of Amazon's dynamic job posting patterns

This implementation addresses the core issues identified in the original problem while maintaining system stability and user experience.
